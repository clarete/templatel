* Introduction

  Templatel is the modern templating language that was missing for
  Emacs-Lisp.  It aims to be powerful and easy to use.

  #+BEGIN_SRC jinja2
  {% extends "layout.html" %}
  {% block body %}
    <h1>Project List</h1>
    <ul>
      {% for project in projects %}
        <li><a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ project.name }}</a></li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  {% endblock %}
  #+END_SRC

* Installation

** Via Melpa

   The simplest and recommended way to get yourself a copy of
   ~templatel~ is to install it via [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]].  You must have something
   along these lines on your Emacs configuration for that to work:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (package-initialize)
   (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
   #+END_SRC

   And then, you can just ~M-x package-install RET templatel RET~.
   Notice that you might need to run ~M-x package-refresh-contents
   RET~ if you haven't done that in a while.
