#+TITLE: Introduction to templatel
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil

* Introduction

  /templatel/ is the modern templating language that was missing for
  Emacs-Lisp.  It provides variable substitution and control flow
  through a clean and powerful language inspired by Python's [[https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/][Jinja]].

  #+BEGIN_SRC jinja2
  {% extends "base.html" %}
  {% block title %}<h1>{{ title }}</h1>{% endblock %}
  {% block body %}
    <ul>
      {% for page in pages %}
        <li><a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a></li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  {% endblock %}
  #+END_SRC

* Installation

** Via Melpa

   The simplest and recommended way to get yourself a copy of
   ~templatel~ is to install it via [[https://melpa.org][MELPA]].  You must have something
   along these lines on your Emacs configuration for that to work:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (package-initialize)
   (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
   #+END_SRC

   And then run ~M-x package-install RET templatel RET~.  Notice that
   you might need to run ~M-x package-refresh-contents RET~ if you
   haven't done that in a while.

** Manually

   If you don't want to use any package installer, you can just clone
   the repository somewhere on your computer, let's say
   ~$HOME/src/templatel~.  And then you need to add that directory to
   your Emacs configuration so the library can be found by ~require~.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/templatel")
   #+END_SRC

* Project Status

  Although /templatel/ has been been functional since it's very first
  lil version, it's still too early to say it's stable.  Until we
  reach 1.0, expect changes in the ~API~ as well as in the language
  itself.  That being said, there will be an effort to keep
  compatibility with previous versions.

* Differences from Jinja

  There are a few things that won't ever be the same, because jinja
  was designed for Python and templatel is designed for Emacs Lisp.
  Most of these differences come out subtly like the rules for
  truthiness in the two host languages.

  Templatel doesn't implement the following features:

  - Some built-in filters
  - For loop variables (loop.index, loop.first, loop.last, etc)
  - Whitespace Control
  - List and tuple literals
  - Else branch in for loops
  - Macros, Macro Calls and Import
  - Named Block End-Tags
  - Extensible Syntax
  - Autoescape Overrides
  - Assignments/Block Assignments
  - With Statement
  - Dictionary Syntax (access items with square brackets)
  - Line Statements

  They are roughly sorted by how likely it would be for them to be
  implemented in templatel.  Pull requests for making templatel more
  compatible to jinja are always welcome.

* Changelog

** 0.1.6
   * Default variables to ~undefined~ instead of raising an error
   * Added test operator ~is~ that is another syntax for passing
     parameters to functions that have a defined signature, they must
     return a Boolean value. e.g.: ~{% if something is defined %}~.
   * Support ~{% include %}~ statements (Thanks to [[https://github.com/guilhermecomum/][Guilherme Guerra]])
   * New tests added: ~defined~, ~divisible~
   * New filters added: ~take~ (Thanks to [[https://github.com/markokocic][Marko KociÄ‡]]), ~abs~,
     capitalize, ~escape~ (~e~), ~float~, ~join~, ~length~, ~max~,
     ~min~, ~round~, and ~title~.  Documentation is still ongoing, and
     help is wanted :)
   * Filter deprecated: ~getattr~, please use ~attr~ instead
   * fix: for loop must access expression via value stack [[[https://github.com/clarete/templatel/commit/42be57bed82335636ce159bcb861f28377ec6c0c][commit]]]
   * fix: parsing floating point numbers [[[https://github.com/clarete/templatel/commit/80b2b355da92b4bb37b4ffa373cfafc562d60f1a][commit]]]
   * fix: filter operator precedence [[[https://github.com/clarete/templatel/commit/7e6034ec20b633ac6e8a9acd1b2cfc7126d1a30a][commit]]]
   * fix: operators for remainder of division (~%~) and exponential
     ~**~ implemented.  They were present in the sintax but didn't
     have an implementation

** 0.1.5
   - New filters added: ~first~, ~last~, ~getattr~ and ~default~
   - New API for removing a template from an environment by name:
     ~templatel-env-remove-template~
   - Fix inheritance so both ~extends~ and ~super()~ work
     recursively. E.g.: ~post.html~ extends ~base_post.html~ that
     extends ~base.html~.
   - Render ~nil~ value as an empty string instead of inserting the
     ~"nil"~ string into the output file

** 0.1.4
   * Add support for automatic HTML entity escaping
   * Fix reading UTF-8 characters with more than one byte
   * Documentation overhauling

** 0.1.3
   * Support for named arguments on filters.  They are passed to the
     handler as an ~assoc~ list. E.g.: ~{{ foo(var1="val", var2=2) }}~
     will get ~((var1 . val) (var2 . 2))~ as the only parameter.
     Named and positional arguments can be mixed, but the Emacs-Lisp
     handler will have to deal with the order.

** 0.1.2
   * Support for user defined filter functions via
     ~templatel-env-add-filter~ and ~templatel-env-remove-filter~.
   * Fix parsing expressions and statements without spaces after
     brackets, e.g.: ~{{var}}~, ~{%if stuff%}~
   * Parse and evaluate standalone function calls.  E.g.: ~{{ super() }}~
   * Breaking change: ~super()~ is now a function, not a variable
     anymore.  But still only exists while blocks are evaluated

** 0.1.1
   * Fix ~elif~ without else statements
   * Make ~templatel-env-{source,run-importfn}~ private
   * Pretty big refactoring cleaning up the symbol names
   * Documentation of the project was kicked off
